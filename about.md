## About Me

Hi, I'm Michele. 

I'm currently working as a Machine Learning Research Engineer at GameBench Labs, specialising in Computer Vision and creating novel in-house image analysis tools. Previously, I have worked as a Data Scientist at Tortoise Media in charge of researching, collecting, and analysing public data using a mixture of machine learning, web scraping and other various APIs. Alongside this I would develop tools to assist my colleagues in providing robust, efficient and comprehensive analysis of this data.

Academically, I have achieved an MSc in Data Science and Analytics from *The University of Leeds* and prior to this I achieved my BSc (Hons) in Mathematics and Computer Science at *The University of York*. During my studies I gained an extensive background of skills, focusing predominantly within Mathematics and Machine Learning, which have allowed me to undertake a variety of projects to further strengthen my skillset.
