## About Me

Hi, I'm Michele. 

I'm currently a postgraduate studying Data Science at The University of Leeds. Prior to commencing postgraduate study, I studied my BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science at The University of York. During my studies I gained an extensive background of skills, focusing predominantly within Python and Machine Learning, which allowed me to undertake a variety of projects to further strengthen my skillset.

For more information, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pascalemp/), or via any of the other links on my [homepage](https://pascalemp.github.io/).   

## Languages and Technologies

#### Python:
```python
years_experience = 0

for years in range(0,5):
    years_experience += 1

print(f'I have {years_experience} years of Python experience.')
```

#### Java:
```java
public class MyExperience{

     public static void main(String []args){
        int years_experience = 0;

        for (int year = 0; year < 5; year++) {
            years_experience += 1;
        }

        String output = String.format("%s %d %s", "I have", 
            years_experience, "years experience in Java.");
        
        System.out.println(output);
    }
}
```
