## About Me

Hi, I'm Michele. 

I'm currently a postgraduate studying Data Science at The University of Leeds. Prior to commencing postgraduate study, I studied my BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science at The University of York. During my studies I gained an extensive background of skills, focusing predominantly within Python and Machine Learning, which allowed me to undertake a variety of projects to further strengthen my skillset.

For more information, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pascalemp/), or via any of the other links on my [homepage](https://pascalemp.github.io/).   

## Languages and Technologies

Python:
```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
import pandas as pd
import torch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from modulefinder import ModuleFinder

skill_set = {}

finder = ModuleFinder()
finder.run_script("this_script.py")

for name, mod in finder.modules.items():
    skill_set.append(name)

total_experience = 0

for i in range(0,5):
    experience += 1

print(f'I have {total_experience} years of Python experience. \
        I also have extensive experience with the following modules: \n
        {skill_set}')
