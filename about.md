## About Me

Hi, I'm Michele!

I'm currently a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London, where I focus on the mathematical theory of Inverse Problems and Machine Learning, with applications in imaging.

Before starting my PhD, I earned an MPhil in Machine Learning from University College London, an MSc in Data Science and Analytics from The University of Leeds, and a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics and Computer Science from The University of York.

In between my MSc and MPhil, I worked as a Machine Learning Research Engineer at GameBench Labs, specializing in Computer Vision and developing innovative in-house image analysis tools. I also spent time as a Data Scientist at Tortoise Media, where I led projects involving research, data collection, and analysis of public datasets using machine learning, web scraping, and various APIs.
