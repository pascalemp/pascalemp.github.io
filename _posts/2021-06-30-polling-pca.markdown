## Background

In order to ensure opinion polls are reflective of a general population, a broad demographic must be sampled, ideally at random. Because of this, these subsets must also be unbiased and well informed in order to reduce potential opinion swaying and misrepresentation bias from media outlets. Polling companies hold major responsibility when it comes to both introducing and alleviating bias, especially when these results are being presented by large corporations and authorities to the public. Because of the broad spectrum of polling companies that currently exist, their methodologies and tactics are not uniform, and so it is advantageous to investigate the different methodologies and trends that a sample of these polls employ.
